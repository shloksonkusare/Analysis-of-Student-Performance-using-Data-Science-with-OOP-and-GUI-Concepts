# Analysis-of-Student-Performance-using-Data-Science-with-OOP-and-GUI-Concepts
this project aims to answer the crucial requirement for segmentation and analysis of student performance in universities by utilizing the power of machine learning, OOP, and GUI ideas.

- Components Used
1. **Tkinter**: Tkinter is a standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit for Python.  
2. **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a comprehensive plotting library for Python, providing a wide range of high-quality 2D plotting capabilities.
3. **Pandas**: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python, offering versatile data structures and functions for handling structured data effectively.
4. **Scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn is a comprehensive machine learning library for Python, providing tools for building and evaluating various machine learning models.

#### Type of OOP Concepts Used:
- **Inheritance**: The code employs inheritance to create specialized classes `(BasicDataProcessor and DataWrangling)` that inherit attributes and methods from more general classes `(DataProcessor and BasicDataProcessor)`. This promotes code reuse and supports the `"is-a" relationship` between classes.

- **Multilevel Inheritance** is implemented in this code.

- **Encapsulation**: Each class encapsulates specific functionalities related to data processing, such as loading data `(loadData())`, handling missing values `(handleMissingValues())`, and generating visualizations `(pieChart())`. Encapsulation helps organize related code into cohesive units and hides internal implementation details from external users.
